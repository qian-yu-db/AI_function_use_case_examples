# Use Case Description

The insurance call center operation is an important customer facing function for any insurance company. The call center is responsible for handling customer inquiries, processing claims, and providing support to policyholders. The operation of the call center can have a significant impact on customer satisfaction and retention, as well as the overall efficiency of the insurance company.

The goals of the analysis are to: 

1. study and track the performance of operators and satisfaction of the customers to identify the area of improvement
2. provide personalized recommendations to the operators to improve the customer experience

In this example, we will demonstrate how to use the AI function for Databricks LLM Batch 
Inference to analyze customer call transcripts and provide insights into customer intent, 
sentiment, compliance with company policies. We will also show how to recommend the next 
best action for the customer service agent based on the analysis.
